// Set before doing the destroy, so if context.destroy() gets called via another bean

// we are marked as destroyed already to prevent running destroy() twice

// use autowired attributes, as that would be confusing, as sometimes the attributes

// would be wired, and sometimes not.

//

// the global event servers used by AG Grid is autowired by the context once, and this

// setBeans method gets called once.

// the times when this class is used outside of the context (eg RowNode has an instance of this

// class) then it is not a bean, and this setBeans method is not called.

// Note: 'autoCreateListenerCollection' should only be 'true' if a listener is about to be added. For instance

// getListeners() is also called during event dispatch even though no listeners are added. This measure protects

// against 'memory bloat' as empty collections will prevent the RowNode's event service from being removed after

// the RowComp is destroyed, see noRegisteredListenersExist() below.

// AG-7893 - Persist composedPath() so that its result can still be accessed by the user asynchronously.

// Within an async event handler if they call composedPath() on the event it will always return an empty [].

// this gets called inside the grid's thread, for each event that it

// wants to set async. the grid then batches the events into one setTimeout()

// because setTimeout() is an expensive operation. ideally we would have

// each event in it's own setTimeout(), but we batch for performance.

// add to the queue for executing later in the next VM turn

// check if timeout is already scheduled. the first time the grid calls

// this within it's thread turn, this should be false, so it will schedule

// the 'flush queue' method the first time it comes here. then the flag is

// set to 'true' so it will know it's already scheduled for subsequent calls.

// if not scheduled, schedule one

// mark that it is scheduled

// this happens in the next VM turn only, and empties the queue of events

// we take a copy, because the event listener could be using

// the grid, which would cause more events, which would be potentially

// added to the queue, so safe to take a copy, the new events will

// get executed in a later VM turn rather than risk updating the

// queue as we are flushing it.

// if we are not column spanning, this just returns back the virtual centre columns,

// columns, so we have to work out the list for each individual row.

// for headers, we never filter out autoHeaderHeight columns, if calculating

// we never filter out autoHeight columns, as we need them in the DOM for calculating Auto Height

// When running within jsdom the viewportRight is always 0, so we need to return true to allow

// tests to validate all the columns.

// used by:

// + angularGrid -> setting pinned body width

// note: this should be cached

// store all original cols and their index.

// if the column was not in the list, we add it as it's a change

// idx is irrelevant now.

// otherwise remove this col, as it's unchanged.

// returns the width we can set to this col, taking into consideration min and max widths

// @takeFromAdjacent - if user has 'shift' pressed, then pixels are taken from adjacent column

// @finished - ends up in the event, tells the user if more events are to come

// every col has a min width, so sum them all up and see if we have enough room

// for all the min widths

// if at least one columns has no max width, it means the group of columns

// then has no max width, as at least one column can take as much width as possible

// method takes sets of columns and resizes them. either all sets will be resized, or nothing

// be resized. this is used for example when user tries to resize a group and holds shift key,

// then both the current group (grows), and the adjacent group (shrinks), will get resized,

// so that's two sets for this method.

// keep track of pixels used, and last column gets the remaining,

// to cater for rounding errors, and min width adjustments

// this should never happen, but in the future, someone might introduce a bug here,

// so we stop the browser from hanging and report bug properly

// even though we are not going to resize beyond min/max size, we still need to dispatch event when finished

// make a copy of what the grid columns would look like after the move

// returns the provided cols sorted in same order as they appear in grid columns. eg if grid columns

// contains [a,b,c,d,e] and col passed is [e,a] then the passed cols are sorted into [a,e]

// Placement is a number indicating 'left' 'center' or 'right' as 0 1 2

// If placement goes down, we're not in the correct order

// + angularGrid -> for setting body width

// + rowController -> setting main row widths (when inserting and resizing)

// need to cache this

// after setColumnWidth or updateGroupsAndDisplayedColumns

// this is used by virtual col calculation, for RTL only, as a change to body width can impact displayed

// columns, due to RTL inverting the y coordinates

// + rowController

// + clientSideRowModel

// + toolPanel

// + rowController -> while inserting rows

// + clientSideRowController -> sorting, building quick filter text

// + headerRenderer -> sorting (clearing icon)

// + moveColumnController

// does an action on a set of columns. provides common functionality for looking up the

// columns based on key, getting a list of effected columns, and then updated the event

// with either one column (if it was just one col) or a list of columns

// used by: autoResize, setVisible, setPinned

// the column keys this action will be on

// the action to do - if this returns false, the column was skipped

// and won't be included in the event

// should return back a column event of the right type

// need to check for false with type (ie !== instead of !=)

// as not returning anything (undefined) would also be false

// + rowRenderer -> for navigation

// pick the last displayed column in this group

// keep moving to the next col, until we get to another group

// get group at same level as the one we are looking for

// for fast looking, store the index of each column

// auto group columns are re-created so deferring syncing with ColumnState

// Will trigger secondary column changes if pivoting modified

// autogroup cols with nothing else, apply the default

// If there are still states left over, see if we can apply them to newly generated

// secondary or auto columns. Also if defaults exist, ensure they are applied to secondary cols

// auto group columns, if missing from state list, are added to the start.

// it's common to have autoGroup missing, as grouping could be on by default

// on a column, but the user could of since removed the grouping via the UI.

// if we don't inc the insert index, autoGroups will be inserted in reverse order

// normal columns, if missing from state list, are added at the end

// this is already done in updateGridColumns, however we changed the order above (to match the order of the state

// columns) so we need to do it again. we could of put logic into the order above to take into account fixed

// columns, however if we did then we would have logic for updating fixed columns twice. reusing the logic here

// is less sexy for the code here, but it keeps consistency.

// if the first list had it, delete it, as it's unchanged.

// if the second list has it, and first doesn't, add it.

// dispatches generic ColumnEvents where all columns are returned rather than what has changed

// special handling for moved column events

// compare each value to the first value. if nothing differs, then value is common so return it.

// values differ, no common value

// we are only interested in columns that were both present and visible before and after

// we do not do aggFunc, rowGroup or pivot for auto cols or secondary cols

// Note: we do not call column.setAggFunc(null), so that next time we aggregate

// by this column (eg drag the column to the agg section int he toolpanel) it will

// default to the last aggregation function.

// used by growGroupPanel

// most of the time this method gets called the key is a string, so we put this shortcut in

// for performance reasons, to see if we can match for ID (it doesn't do auto columns, that's done below)

// location is where the column is going to appear, ie who is calling us

// only columns with aggregation active can have aggregations

// otherwise we have a measure that is active, and we are doing aggregation on it

// Skip decorating the header - in this case the label is the pivot key, not the value col

// returns the group with matching colId and instanceId. If instanceId is missing,

// matches only on the colId.

// aggFunc doesn't have index variant, cos order of value cols doesn't matter, so always return null

// aggFunc is a string, so return it's existence

// null or empty string means clear

// return false if any of the following: null, undefined, empty string

// all new columns added will have aggFunc missing, so set it to what is in the colDef

// if aggFunc provided, we always override, as reactive property

// otherwise we use initialAggFunc only if no agg func set - which happens when new column only

// sort cols with index, and add these first

// go though all cols.

// if value, change

// if default only, change only if new

// as no value or index is 'present' we use the default / initial when col is new

// second add columns that were there before and in the same order as they were before,

// so we are preserving order of current grouping of columns that simply have rowGroup=true

// lastly put in all remaining cols

// set flag=false for removed cols

// set flag=true for newly added cols

// called by headerRenderer - when a header is opened or closed

// if (key instanceof ProvidedColumnGroup) { return key; }

// otherwise, search for the column group by id

// pivot mode is on, but we are not pivoting, so we only

// show columns we are aggregating on

// also called when group opened/closed

// called from: applyColumnState, setColumnDefs, setSecondaryColumns

// if auto group cols have changed, and we have a sort order, we need to move auto cols to the start

// if group cols have changed, remove them from any previous orders and add them to the start.

// If the current columns are the same or a subset of the previous

// we keep the previous order, otherwise we go back to the order the pivot

// cols are generated in

// updateGridColumns gets called after user adds a row group. we want to maintain the order of the columns

// when this happens (eg if user moved a column) rather than revert back to the original column order.

// likewise if changing in/out of pivot mode, we want to maintain the order of the cols

// create the new auto columns

// if no parent, means we are not grouping, so just add the column to the end

// find the group the column belongs to. if no siblings at the current level (eg col in group on it's

// own) then go up one level and look for siblings there.

// if no siblings exist at any level, this means the col is in a group (or parent groups) on it's own

// find index of last column in the group

// if we are using autoGroupCols, then they should be included for quick filter. this covers the

// following scenarios:

// a) user provides 'field' into autoGroupCol of normal grid, so now because a valid col to filter leafs on

// b) using tree data and user depends on autoGroupCol for first col, and we also want to filter on this

//    (tree data is a bit different, as parent rows can be filtered on, unlike row grouping)

// gets called after we copy down grid columns, to make sure any part of the gui

// that tries to draw, eg the header, it will get empty lists of columns rather

// than stale columns. for example, the header will received gridColumnsChanged

// event, so will try and draw, but it will draw successfully when it acts on the

// virtualColumnsChanged event

// this event is picked up by the gui, headerRenderer and rowRenderer, to recalculate what columns to display

// sets the left pixel position of each column

// items left in allColumns are columns not displayed, so remove the left position. this is

// important for the rows, as if a col is made visible, then taken out, then made visible again,

// we don't want the animation of the cell floating in from the old position, whatever that was.

// go through each list of displayed columns

// a groups left value is the lest left value of it's children

// no virtualisation, so don't filter

// filter out what should be visible

// go through each group, see if any of it's cols are displayed, and if yes,

// then this group is included

// for easy lookup when building the groups.

// see if this item is within viewport

// for column, test if column is included

// If the grid has left-over space, divide it between flexing columns in proportion to their flex value.

// A "flexing column" is one that has a 'flex' value set and is not currently being constrained by its

// minWidth or maxWidth rules.

// find the last resizing col, as only cols after this one are affected by the resizing

// the width of all of the columns for which the width has been determined

// this is for performance to prevent trying to flex when unnecessary

// known columns and the minimum width of all the flex cols are too wide for viewport

// so don't flex

// No columns should flex, but all have been changed. Swap arrays so events fire properly.

// Expensive logic won't execute as flex columns is empty.

// This column is not in fact flexing as it is being constrained to a specific size

// so remove it from the list of flexing columns and start again

// called from api

// resetting cols to their original width makes the sizeColumnsToFit more deterministic,

// rather than depending on the current size of the columns. most users call sizeColumnsToFit

// immediately after grid is created, so will make no difference. however if application is calling

// sizeColumnsToFit repeatedly (eg after column group is opened / closed repeatedly) we don't want

// the columns to start shrinking / growing over time.

// NOTE: the process below will assign values to `this.actualWidth` of each column without firing events

// for this reason we need to manually dispatch resize events after the resize has been done for each column.

// no width, set everything to minimum

// backwards through loop, as we are removing items as we go

// we set the pixels for the last col based on what's left, as otherwise

// we could be a pixel or two short or extra because of rounding errors.

// if this is the last column

// see notes above

// check for reference, in case new column / group with same id is now present

/**

// we need to allow suppressing auto-column separately for group and pivot as the normal situation

// is CSRM and user provides group column themselves for normal view, but when they go into pivot the

// columns are generated by the grid so no opportunity for user to provide group column. so need a way

// to suppress auto-col for grouping only, and not pivot.

// however if using Viewport RM or SSRM and user is providing the columns, the user may wish full control

// eSortIndicator will not be present when customers provided custom header

// see if we are showing a Group Value for the Displayed Group. if we are showing a group value, and this Row Node

// this is the normal case, in that we are showing a group for which this column is configured. note that

// this means the Row Group is closed (if it was open, we would not be displaying it)

// we try and use the cellRenderer of the column used for the grouping if we can

// for full width rows, we don't do any of the below

// when grouping, the normal case is we use the cell renderer of the grouped column. eg if grouping by country

// and then rating, we will use the country cell renderer for each country group row and likewise the rating

// cell renderer for each rating group row.

// however if the user has innerCellRenderer defined, this gets preference and we don't use cell renderers

// of the grouped columns.

// so we check and use in the following order:

// 1) thisColDef.cellRendererParams.innerRenderer of the column showing the groups (eg auto group column)

// 2) groupedColDef.cellRenderer of the grouped column

// 3) groupedColDef.cellRendererParams.innerRenderer

// we check if cell renderer provided for the group cell renderer, eg colDef.cellRendererParams.innerRenderer

// only include the child count if it's included, eg if user doing custom aggregation,

// then this could be left out, or set to -1, ie no child count

// filtering changes the child count, so need to cater for it

// expand / contract as the user hits enter

// so if we expand a node, it does not also get selected.

// must use the displayedGroup, so if data was dragged down, we expand the parent, not this row

// it not expandable, show neither

// maybe if no children now, we should hide the expand / contract icons

// if we have no children, this impacts the indent

// only do this if an indent - as this overwrites the padding that

// the theme set, which will make things look 'not aligned' for the

// first group level.

// if a function, we always return true as change detection can show or hide the checkbox.

// footers cannot be selected

// pinned rows cannot be selected

// details cannot be selected

// we want to avoid acting on double click events on the expand / contract icon,

// as that icons already has expand / collapse functionality on it. otherwise if

// the icon was double clicked, we would get 'click', 'click', 'dblclick' which

// each part must pass, if any fails, then the whole filter fails

// at this point, processedFields contains data for which we don't have a filter working yet

// because user can provide filters, we provide useful error checking and messages

// called by:

// 1) onFilterChanged()

// 2) onNewRowsLoaded()

// this never happens, including to avoid compile error

// the only filters that can appear on secondary columns are groupAgg filters

// primary columns are only ever groupAgg filters if a) value is active and b) showing primary columns

// from here on we know: isPrimary=true, isValueActive=true, isShowingPrimaryColumns=true

// because users can do custom filters, give nice error message

// sometimes (especially in React) the filter can call onFilterChanged when we are in the middle

// of a render cycle. this would be bad, so we wait for render cycle to complete when this happens.

// this happens in react when we change React State in the grid (eg setting RowCtrl's in RowContainer)

// which results in React State getting applied in the main application, triggering a useEffect() to

// be kicked off adn then the application calling the grid's API. in AG-6554, the custom filter was

// getting it's useEffect() triggered in this way.

// because internal events are not async in ag-grid, when the dispatchEvent

// method comes back, we know all listeners have finished executing.

// if user has elected to always flash cell changes, then always return false, otherwise we suppress flashing

// changes when filtering

// check quick filter

// the row must pass ALL of the filters, so if any of them fail,

// we return true. that means if a row passes the quick filter,

// but fails the column filter, it fails overall

// first up, check quick filter

// secondly, give the client a chance to reject this row

// for backwards compatibility with Angular 1 - we

// used to allow providing back HTML from getGui().

// once we move away from supporting Angular 1

// directly, we can change this.

// When a filter changes as a side effect of a column changes,

// we report 'api' as the source, so that the client can distinguish

// onFilterChanged does this already

// Group column filters can be dependant on underlying column filters, but don't normally get created until they're used for the first time.

// Instead, create them by default when any filter changes.

// for group filters, can change dynamically whether they are allowed or not

// defer to filter component isFilterAllowed if it exists

// destroys the filter, so it no longer takes part

// Case when filter component changes

// Otherwise - Check for refresh method before destruction

// If refresh() method is implemented - call it and destroy filter if it returns false

// Otherwise - do nothing ( filter will not be destroyed - we assume new params are compatible with old ones )

// framework wrapper always implements optional methods, but returns null if no underlying method

// react hooks returns new wrappers, so check nested render method

// don't need to destroy the listeners as they are managed listeners

// this is true when the grid is processing the filter change. this is used by the cell comps, so that they

// don't flash when data changes due to filter changes. there is no need to flash when filter changes as the

// user is in control, so doesn't make sense to show flashing changes. for example, go to main demo where

// this feature is turned off (hack code to always return false for isSuppressFlashingCellsBecauseFiltering(), put in)

// 100,000 rows and group by country. then do some filtering. all the cells flash, which is silly.

// when we're waiting for cell data types to be inferred, we need to defer filter model updates

// because we are providing defaultFloatingFilterType, we know it will never be undefined;

// returns either 'print', 'autoHeight' or 'normal' (normal is the default)

// because RTL is all backwards, a change in the width of the row

// can cause a change in the scroll position, without a scroll event,

// because the scroll position in RTL is a function that depends on

// the width. to be convinced of this, take out this line, enable RTL,

// scroll all the way to the left and then resize a column

// when doing RTL, this method gets called once prematurely

// we do Math.round() rather than Math.floor(), to mirror how scroll values are applied.

// eg if a scale is applied (ie user has zoomed the browser), then applying scroll=200

// could result in 199.88, which then floor(199.88) = 199, however round(199.88) = 200.

// initially Math.floor() was used, however this caused (almost) infinite loop with aligned grids,

// as the scroll would move 1px at at time bouncing from one grid to the next (eg one grid would cause

// scroll to 200px, the next to 199px, then the first back to 198px and so on).

// the `scrollGridIfNeeded` will recalculate the rows to be rendered by the grid

// so it should only be called after `eBodyViewport` has been scrolled to the correct

// position, otherwise the `first` and `last` row could be miscalculated.

// sometimes when scrolling, we got values that extended the maximum scroll allowed. we used to

// ignore these scrolls. problem is the max scroll position could be skipped (eg the previous scroll event

// could be 10px before the max position, and then current scroll event could be 20px after the max position).

// if we just ignored the last event, we would be setting the scroll to 10px before the max position, when in

// actual fact the user has exceeded the max scroll and thus scroll should be set to the max.

// touch devices allow elastic scroll - which temporally scrolls the panel outside of the viewport

// (eg user uses touch to go to the left of the grid, but drags past the left, the rows will actually

// scroll past the left until the user releases the mouse). when this happens, we want ignore the scroll,

// as otherwise it was causing the rows and header to flicker.

// this is to cater for AG-3274, where grid is removed from the dom and then inserted back in again.

// (which happens with some implementations of tabbing). this can result in horizontal scroll getting

// reset back to the left, however no scroll event is fired. so we need to get header to also scroll

// back to the left to be kept in sync.

// adding and removing the grid from the DOM both resets the scroll position and

// triggers a resize event, so notify listeners if the scroll position has changed

// called by scrollHorizontally method and alignedGridsService

// if this is call is coming from the alignedGridsService, we don't need to validate the

// scroll, because it has already been validated by the grid firing the scroll event.

// we need to manually do the event handling (rather than wait for the event)

// for the alignedGridsService, as if we don't, the aligned grid service gets

// notified async, and then it's 'consuming' flag doesn't get used right, and

// we can end up with an infinite loop

// Valid values for position are bottom, middle and top

// look for the node index we want to display

// go through all the nodes, find the one we want to show

// if undefined/null, then the grid will to the minimal amount of scrolling,

//    if row is already in view, grid does not scroll

// if row is after, scroll down with row at bottom

// check this, in case focus is on a (for example) a text field inside the cell,

// in which cse we should not be listening for these key pressed

// if we don't prevent default, then the event also gets applied to the text field

// (at least when doing the default editor), but we need to allow the editor to decide

// what it wants to do. we only do this IF editing was started - otherwise it messes

// up when the use is not doing editing, but using rendering with text fields in cellRenderer

// if we are in the middle of 'stopEditing', then we don't refresh here, as refresh gets called explicitly

// we do cellClassRules even if the value has not changed, so that users who have rules that

// look at other parts of the row (where the other part of the row might of changed) will work.

// cell editors call this, when they want to stop for reasons other

// unique id to this instance, including the column ID to help with debugging in React as it's used in 'key'

// pinned rows render before the main grid body in the SSRM, only fire the event after the main body has rendered.

// this is fired within setComp as we know that the component renderer is now trying to render.

// linked with the fact the function implementation queues behind requestAnimationFrame should allow

// us to be certain that all rendering is done by the time the event fires.

// no need to calculate styles already set in constructor

// DOM DATA

// adding hover functionality adds listener to this row, so we

// do it lazily in an animation frame

// the height animation we only want active after the row is alive for 1 second.

// this stops the row animation working when rows are initially created. otherwise

// auto-height rows get inserted into the dom and resized immediately, which gives

// very bad UX (eg 10 rows get inserted, then all 10 expand, look particularly bad

// when scrolling). so this makes sure when rows are shown for the first time, they

// are resized immediately without animation.

// use by autoWidthCalculator, as it clones the elements

// areAllContainersReady asserts that centerGui is not null

// we use instanceId's rather than colId as it's possible there is a Column with same Id,

// but it's referring to a different column instance. Happens a lot with pivot, as pivot col id's are

// reused eg pivot_0, pivot_1 etc

// we want to try and keep editing and focused cells

// if the row had a previous position, we slide it in

// if the row had no previous position, we fade it in

// no refresh needed

// returns 'true' if refresh succeeded

// if the master row node has updated data, we also want to try to refresh the detail row

// if the row is rendered incorrectly, as the requirements for whether this is a FW row have changed, we force re-render this row.

// this bit of logic handles trying to refresh the FW row ctrl, or delegating to removing/recreating it if unsupported.

// if this is an update, we want to refresh, as this will allow the user to put in a transition

// into the cellRenderer refresh method. otherwise this might be completely new data, in which case

// we will want to completely replace the cells

// as data has changed update the dom row id attributes

// check for selected also, as this could be after lazy loading of the row data, in which case

// the id might of just gotten set inside the row and the row selected state may of changed

// as a result. this is what happens when selected rows are loaded in virtual pagination.

// - niall note - since moving to the stub component, this may no longer be true, as replacing

// the stub component now replaces the entire row

// as data has changed, then the style and class needs to be recomputed

// we skip animations for onDisplayedColumnChanged, as otherwise the client could remove columns and

// then set data, and any old valueGetter's (ie from cols that were removed) would still get called.

// can happen with react ui, comp not yet ready

// we don't scroll normal rows into view when we focus them, so we don't want

// to scroll Full Width rows either.

// when first developing this, we included the rowComp in the event.

// this seems very weird. so when introducing the event types, i left the 'source'

// out of the type, and just include the source in the two places where this event

// was fired (rowClicked and rowDoubleClicked). it doesn't make sense for any

// users to be using this, as the rowComp isn't an object we expose, so would be

// very surprising if a user was using it.

// we do not allow selecting groups by clicking (as the click here expands the group), or if it's a detail row,

// so return if it's a group row

// this is needed so we don't unselect other rows when we click this row, eg if this row is not selectable,

// and we click it, the selection should not change (ie any currently selected row should stay selected)

// we also don't allow selection of pinned rows

// if no selection method enabled, do nothing

// if click selection suppressed, do nothing

// selected with no multi key, must make sure anything else is unselected

// if the UI is not ready, the height can be 0, which we ignore, as otherwise a flicker will occur

// as UI goes from the default height, to 0, then to the real height as UI becomes ready. this means

// it's not possible for have 0 as auto-height, however this is an improbable use case, as even an

// empty detail grid would still have some styling around it giving at least a few pixels.

// these need to be taken out, as part of 'afterAttached' now

// if we are already stopping row edit, there is

// no need to start this process again.

// don't do it if already editing

// part 1 - rowStyle

// Return constant reference for React

// part 1 - rowStyleFunc

// Treat undefined as false, if we pass undefined down it gets treated as toggle class, rather than explicitly

// setting the required value

// because we use animation frames to do this, it's possible the row no longer exists

// by the time we get to add it

// because mouseenter and mouseleave do not propagate, we cannot listen on the gridPanel

// like we do for all the other mouse events.

// because of the pinning, we cannot simply add / remove the class based on the eRow. we

// have to check all eRow's (body & pinned). so the trick is if any of the rows gets a

// mouse hover, it sets such in the rowNode, and then all three reflect the change as

// all are listening for event on the row node.

// step 1 - add listener, to set flag on row node

// step 2 - listen for changes on row node (which any eRow can trigger)

// if hover turned off, we don't add the class. we do this here so that if the application

// toggles this property mid way, we remove the hover form the last row, but we stop

// adding hovers from that point onwards. Also, do not highlight while dragging elements around.

// for animation, we don't want to animate entry or exit to a very far away pixel,

// otherwise the row would move so fast, it would appear to disappear. so this method

// moves the row closer to the viewport if it is far away, so the row slide in / out

// at a speed the user can see.

// check for exists first - if the user is resetting the row height, then

// it will be null (or undefined) momentarily until the next time the flatten

// stage is called where the row will then update again with a new height

// If the row height is coming from a function, this means some rows can

// be smaller than the theme had intended. so we set --ag-line-height on

// the row, which is picked up by the theme CSS and is used in a calc

// for the CSS line-height property, which makes sure the line-height is

// not bigger than the row height, otherwise the row text would not fit.

// We do not use rowNode.rowHeight here, as this could be the result of autoHeight,

// and we found using the autoHeight result causes a loop, where changing the

// line-height them impacts the cell height, resulting in a new autoHeight,

// resulting in a new line-height and so on loop.

// const heightFromFunc = this.gridOptionsService.getRowHeightForNode(this.rowNode).height;

// note - this is NOT called by context, as we don't wire / unwire the CellComp for performance reasons.

// why do we have this method? shouldn't everything below be added as a destroy func beside

// the corresponding create logic?

// if we are editing, destroying the row will stop editing

// if we are editing, then moving the focus out of a row will stop editing

// it is possible this row is in the new page, but the page number has changed, which means

// it needs to reposition itself relative to the new page

// the pixel offset is used when calculating rowTop to set on the row DIV

// applies pagination offset, eg if on second page, and page height is 500px, then removes

// 500px from the top position, so a row with rowTop 600px is displayed at location 100px.

// reverse will take the offset away rather than add.

// print layout uses normal flow layout for row positioning

// need to make sure rowTop is not null, as this can happen if the node was once

// visible (ie parent group was expanded) but is now not visible

// the top needs to be set into the DOM element when the element is created, not updated afterwards.

// otherwise the transition would not work, as it would be transitioning from zero (the unset value).

// for example, suppose a row that is outside the viewport, then user does a filter to remove other rows

// and this row now appears in the viewport, and the row moves up (ie it was under the viewport and not rendered,

// but now is in the viewport) then a new RowComp is created, however it should have it's position initialised

// to below the viewport, so the row will appear to animate up. if we didn't set the initial position at creation

// time, the row would animate down (ie from position zero).

// if sliding in, we take the old row top. otherwise we just set the current row top.

// first up, check for cell directly linked to this column

// second up, if not found, then check for spanned cols.

// we do this second (and not at the same time) as this is

// more expensive, as spanning cols is a

// infrequently used feature so we don't need to do this most

// of the time

// we only bother updating if the rowIndex is present. if it is not present, it means this row

// is child of a group node, and the group node was closed, it's the only way to have no row index.

// when this happens, row is about to be de-rendered, so we don't care, rowComp is about to die!

// calls to `isFullWidth()` only work after `setRowType` has been called.

// we do NOT want this when not in iPad, otherwise we will be doing

// if not a scroll key, then we pass onto cell

// perform clipboard and undo / redo operations

// check if ctrl or meta key pressed

// if the cell the event came from is editing, then we do not

// want to do the default shortcut keys, otherwise the editor

// (eg a text field) would not be able to do the normal cut/copy/paste

// centerContainer gets horizontal resizes

// eBodyViewport gets vertical resizes

// remove 50px from the bodyWidth to give some margin

// gets called every time the viewport size changes. we use this to check visibility of scrollbars

// in the grid panel, and also to check size and position of viewport for row and column virtualisation.

// results in updating anything that depends on scroll showing

// fires event if height changes, used by PaginationService, HeightScalerService, RowRenderer

// check for virtual columns for ColumnController

// because of column animation (which takes 200ms), we have to do this twice.

// eg if user removes cols anywhere except at the RHS, then the cols on the RHS

// will animate to the left to fill the gap. this animation means just after

// the cols are removed, the remaining cols are still in the original location

// at the start of the animation, so pre animation the H scrollbar is still needed,

// but post animation it is not.

// this gets called whenever a change in the viewport, so we can inform column controller it has to work

// out the virtual columns again. gets called from following locations:

// + ensureColVisible, scroll, init, layoutChanged, displayedColumnsChanged

// sticky section must show rows in set order

// when editing a pinned row, if the cell is half outside the scrollable area, the browser can

// scroll the column into view. we do not want this, the pinned sections should never scroll.

// so we listen to scrolls on these containers and reset the scroll if we find one.

// this methods prevents the grid views from being scrolled while the dragService is being used

// eg. the view should not scroll up and down while dragging rows using the rowDragComp.

// we defer to a util, as how you calculated scrollLeft when doing RTL depends on the browser

// this just justifies if the ctrl is in the correct place, this will be fed with zombie rows by the

// row renderer, so should not block them as they still need to animate -  the row renderer

// will clean these up when they finish animating

// Maintaining a constant reference enables optimization in React.

// used by pagination service - to know page height

// used by header container

// we put the instance id onto the main DOM element. this is used for events, when grids are inside grids,

// so the grid can work out if the even came from this grid or a grid inside this one. see the ctrl+v logic

// for where this is used.

// walks the path of the event, and returns true if this grid is the first one that it finds. if doing

// master / detail grids, and a child grid is found, then it returns false. this stops things like copy/paste

// getting executed on many grids at the same time.

// handle home and end when ctrl & alt are NOT pressed

// handle when ctrl is pressed only, if shift is pressed

// it will be handled by the rangeService

// handle page up and page down when ctrl & alt are NOT pressed

// setFocusedCell relies on the browser default focus behavior to scroll the focused cell into view,

// however, this behavior will cause the cell border to be cut off, or if we have sticky rows, the

// cell will be completely hidden, so we call ensureIndexVisible without a position to guarantee

// minimal scroll to get the row into view.

// if we don't do this, the range will be left on the last cell, which will leave the last focused cell

// highlighted.

// this method is throttled, see the `constructor`

// because autoHeight will calculate the height of rows after scroll

// first we scroll towards the required point, then we add a small

// delay to allow the height to be recalculated, check which index

// should be focused and then finally navigate to that index.

// TODO: we should probably have an event fired once to scrollbar has

// settled and all rowHeights have been calculated instead of relying

// on a setTimeout of 50ms.

// home brings focus to top left cell, end brings focus to bottom right, grid scrolled to bring

// same cell into view (which means either scroll all the way up, or all the way down).

// result of keyboard event

// only prevent default if we found a cell. so if user is on last cell and hits tab, then we default

// to the normal tabbing so user can exit the grid.

// if we didn't move to next cell, then need to tab out of the cells, ie to the header (if going

// backwards)

// if the case it's a popup editor, the focus is on the editor and not the previous cell.

// in order for the tab navigation to work, we need to focus the browser back onto the

// previous cell.

// comes from API

// if no focus, then cannot navigate

// if cell is not editing, there is still chance row is editing if it's Full Row Editing

// if a cell wasn't found, it's possible that focus was moved to the header

// if we are editing, we know it's not a Full Width Row (RowComp)

// before we stop editing, we need to focus the cell element

// so the grid doesn't detect that focus has left the grid

// need to do this before getting next cell to edit, in case the next cell

// has editable function (eg colDef.editable=func() ) and it depends on the

// result of this cell, so need to save updates from the first edit, in case

// the value is referenced in the function.

// find the next cell to start editing

// called by the cell, when tab is pressed while editing.

// @return: RenderedCell when navigation successful, otherwise null

// allow user to override what cell to go to next

// if no 'next cell', means we have got to last cell of grid, so nothing to move to,

// so bottom right cell going forwards, or top left going backwards

// if editing, but cell not editable, skip cell. we do this before we do all of

// the 'ensure index visible' and 'flush all frames', otherwise if we are skipping

// a bunch of cells (eg 10 rows) then all the work on ensuring cell visible is useless

// (except for the last one) which causes grid to stall for a while.

// note - for full row edit, we do focus non-editable cells, as the row stays in edit mode.

// we have to call this after ensureColumnVisible - otherwise it could be a virtual column

// or row that is not currently in view, hence the renderedCell would not exist

// if next cell is fullWidth row, then no rendered cell,

// as fullWidth rows have no cells, so we skip it

// we successfully tabbed onto a grid cell, so return true

// by default, when we click a cell, it gets selected into a range, so to keep keyboard navigation

// consistent, we set into range here also.

// we use index for rows, but column object for columns, as the next column (by index) might not

// be visible (header grouping) so it's not reliable, so using the column object instead.

// we keep searching for a next cell until we find one. this is how the group rows get skipped

// if the current cell is spanning across multiple columns, we need to move

// our current position to be the last cell on the right before finding the

// the next target.

// eg if going down, and nextCell=undefined, means we are gone past the last row

// no next cell means we have reached a grid boundary, eg left, right, top or bottom of grid

// allow user to override what cell to go to next. when doing normal cell navigation (with keys)

// we allow this, however if processing 'enter after edit' we don't allow override

// ensureCellVisible first, to make sure cell at position is rendered.

// not guaranteed to have a cellComp when using the SSRM as blocks are loading.

// we call this again, as nextCell can be different to it's previous value due to Column Spanning

// (ie if cursor moving from right to left, and cell is spanning columns, then nextCell was the

// last column in the group, however now it's the first column in the group). if we didn't do

// ensureCellVisible again, then we could only be showing the last portion (last column) of the

// merged cells.

// we do not allow focusing on detail rows and full width rows

// this scrolls the row into view

// this can happen if the users asks for the cell to refresh, but we are not showing the vale as we are editing

// this means firstRender will be true for one pass only, as it's initialised to undefined

// all of these have dependencies on the eGui, so only do them after eGui is set

// returns true if wrapper was changed

// if empty, userComponentFactory already did a console message

// if different Cell Renderer configured this time (eg user is using selector, and

// returns different component) then don't refresh, force recreate of Cell Renderer

// this can return null in the event that the user has switched from a renderer component to nothing, for example

// when using a cellRendererSelect to return a component or null depending on row data etc

// never use task service if animation frame service is turned off.

// and lastly we never use it if doing auto-height, as the auto-height service checks the

// row height directly after the cell is created, it doesn't wait around for the tasks to complete        

// we only use task service when rendering for first time, which means it is not used when doing edits.

// if we changed this (always use task service) would make sense, however it would break tests, possibly

// test of users.

// if focus is inside the cell, we move focus to the cell itself

// before removing it's contents, otherwise errors could be thrown.

// if a popup, then we wrap in a popup editor and return the popup

// if the row is also getting destroyed, then we don't need to remove from dom,

// as the row will also get removed, so no need to take out the cells from the row

// if the row is going (removing is an expensive operation, so only need to remove

// the top part)

// every time we go into edit mode, or back again, this gets incremented.

// it's the components way of dealing with the async nature of framework components,

// so if a framework component takes a while to be created, we know if the object

// is still relevant when creating is finished. eg we could click edit / un-edit 20

// times before the first React edit component comes back - we should discard

// the first 19.

// could be old reference, ie removed cell

// check cellComp belongs in this container

// destroys all row comps

// don't create new row comps for rows which are not displayed. still want the existing components

// as they may be animating out.

/** Callback for when drag enters */

// in pivot mode, we don't accept any drops if functions are read only

// we don't allow adding secondary columns

/** Callback for when drag leaves */

// if we are taking columns out of the center, then we remove them from the report

/** Callback for when dragging */

/** Callback for when drag stops */

// the two check below stop an error when the user grabs a group my a middle column, then

// it is possible the mouse pointer is to the right of a column while been dragged left.

// so we need to make sure that the mouse pointer is actually left of the left most column

// if moving left, and right of the right most column if moving right

// we check 'fromEnter' below so we move the column to the new spot if the mouse is coming from

// outside the grid, eg if the column is moving from side panel, mouse is moving left, then we should

// place the column to the RHS even if the mouse is moving left and the column is already on

// the LHS. otherwise we stick to the rule described above.

// if the event was faked by a change in column pin state, then the original location of the column

// is not reliable for dictating where the column may now be placed.

// don't consider 'fromEnter' when dragging header cells, otherwise group can jump to opposite direction of drag

// only allow left drag if this column is moving left

// only allow right drag if this column is moving right

// From when we find a move that passes all the rules

// Remember what that move would look like in terms of displayed cols

// keep going with further moves until we find a different result in displayed output

// In this way potentialMoves contains all potential moves over 'hidden' columns

// Stop looking for potential moves if the displayed result changes from the target

// The best move is the move with least group fragmentation

// returns the index of the first column in the list ONLY if the cols are all beside

// each other. if the cols are not beside each other, then returns null

// A measure of how fragmented in terms of groups an order of columns is

// iterate over the longest one

// this is the list of cols on the screen, so it's these we use when comparing the x mouse position

// but this list is the list of all cols, when we move a col it's the index within this list that gets used,

// so the result we return has to be and index location for this list

// if we are dragging right, then the columns will be to the left of the mouse, so we also want to

// include the width of the moving columns

// now count how many of the displayed columns will fit to the left

// trial and error, if going right, we adjust by one, i didn't manage to quantify why, but it works

// the display index is with respect to all the showing columns, however when we move, it's with

// respect to all grid columns, so we need to translate from display index to grid index

// add in other valid moves due to hidden columns and married children. for example, a particular

// move might break a group that has married children (so move isn't valid), however there could

// be hidden columns (not displayed) that we could jump over to make the move valid. because

// they are hidden, user doesn't see any different, however it allows moves that would otherwise

// not work. for example imagine a group with 9 columns and all columns are hidden except the

// middle one (so 4 hidden to left, 4 hidden to right), then when moving 'firstValidMove' will

// be relative to the not-shown column, however we need to consider the move jumping over all the

// hidden children. if we didn't do this, then if the group just described was at the end (RHS) of the

// grid, there would be no way to put a column after it (as the grid would only consider beside the

// visible column, which would fail valid move rules).

// if dragging right, then we add all the additional moves to the right. so in other words

// if the next move is not valid, find the next move to the right that is valid.

// adding columns here means the order is now messed up

// takes into account visible=false and group=closed, ie it is not displayed

// if dragging left we do the reverse of dragging right, we add in all the valid moves to the

// left. however we also have to consider moves to the right for all hidden columns first.

// (this logic is hard to reason with, it was worked out with trial and error,

// more observation rather than science).

// add moves to the right

// add moves to the left

// flip the coordinate if doing RTL

// adjust for scroll only if centre container (the pinned containers don't scroll)

// we do dummy drag, so make sure column appears in the right location when first placed

// the if statement doesn't work if drag leaves grid, then enters again

// if moving up or down (ie not left or right) then do nothing

// if the user is dragging into the panel, ie coming from the side panel into the main grid,

// we don't want to scroll the grid this time, it would appear like the table is jumping

// each time a column is dragged in.

// if not pin locked, then always allowed to be in this container

// the amounts we move get bigger at each interval, so the speed accelerates, starting a bit slow

// and getting faster. this is to give smoother user experience. we max at 100px to limit the speed.

// we count the failed move attempts. if we fail to move 7 times, then we pin the column.

// this is how we achieve pining by dragging the column to the edge of the grid.

// we want to use the bodyPivotTarget if the user is dragging columns in from the toolPanel

// and we are in pivot mode, as it has to logic to set pivot/value/group on the columns when

// dropped into the grid's body.

// in pivot mode, then if moving a column (ie didn't come from toolpanel) then it's

// a standard column move, however if it came from the toolpanel, then we are introducing

// dimensions or values to the grid

// we pick the drop listener depending on whether we are in pivot mode are not. if we are

// in pivot mode, then dropping cols changes the row group, pivot, value stats. otherwise

// we change visibility state and position.

//noinspection JSUnusedLocalSymbols

// ordering the columns by left position orders them in the order they appear on the screen

// if elements within the header are focused, we don't process the event

// if shiftKey and altKey are not pressed, it's cell navigation so we don't process the event

// when in print layout, the left position is also dependent on the width of the pinned sections.

// so additionally update left if any column width changes.

// setting left has a dependency on print layout

// we must keep track of the left we want to set to, as this would otherwise lead to a race

// condition, if the user changed the left value many times in one VM turn, then we want to make

// make sure the actualLeft we set in the timeout below (in the next VM turn) is the correct left

// position. eg if user changes column position twice, then setLeft() below executes twice in next

// VM turn, but only one (the correct one) should get applied.

// test this left value is the latest one to be applied, and if not, do nothing

// if the value is null, then that means the column is no longer

// displayed. there is logic in the rendering to fade these columns

// out, so we don't try and change their left positions.

// empty abstract method

// when the focus is already within the component,

// we default to the browser's behavior

// class already added, no need to apply it, but remove from old set

// class new since last time, so apply it

// now old set only has classes that were applied last time, but not this time, so remove them

// we do this as a refresh happens after colDefs change, and it's possible the column has had it's

// draggable property toggled. no need to call this if not refreshing, as setDragSource is done

// as part of appendHeaderComp

// if no refresh method, then we want to replace the headerComp

// display name can change if aggFunc different, eg sum(Gold) is now max(Gold)

// we should still be allowed drag the column, even if it can't be moved, if the column

// can be dragged to a rowGroup or pivot drop zone

// this is what makes the header go dark when it is been moved (gives impression to

// user that the column was picked up).

// if spanning has stopped then need to reset these values.

// In theory we could rely on the resize observer for everything - but since it's debounced

// it can be a little janky for smooth movement. in this case its better to react to our own events

// the children belonging to this group can change, so we need to add and remove listeners as they change

// sort first by row index (taking into account scroll direction), then by

// order of task creation (always ascending, so cells will render left-to-right)

// check for the existence of requestAnimationFrame, and if

// it's missing, then we polyfill it with setTimeout()

// a debounce utility used for parts of the app involved with rendering.

// the advantage over normal debounce is the client can call flushAllFrames()

// to make sure all rendering is complete. we don't wait any milliseconds,

// as this is intended to batch calls in one VM turn.

// p1 and p2 are create tasks are to do with row and cell creation.

// for them we want to execute according to row order, so we use

// TaskItem so we know what index the item is for.

// eg drawing back-ground of rows

// eg cell renderers, adding hover functionality

// destroy tasks are to do with row removal. they are done after row creation as the user will need to see new

// rows first (as blank is scrolled into view), when we remove the old rows (no longer in view) is not as

// important.

// we need to know direction of scroll, to build up rows in the direction of

// the scroll. eg if user scrolls down, we extend the rows by building down.

// expand all parents recursively, except root node.

// we don't really want the user calling this if only one rowNode was expanded, instead they should be

// calling rowNode.setExpanded(boolean) - this way we do a 'keepRenderedRows=false' so that the whole

// grid gets refreshed again - otherwise the row with the rowNodes that were changed won't get updated,

// and thus the expand icon in the group cell won't get 'opened' or 'closed'.

// this is the trick: we create a dummy container and clone all the cells

// into the dummy, then check the dummy's width. then destroy the dummy

// as we don't need it any more.

// drawback: only the cells visible on the screen are considered

// cell isn't visible

// we only consider the lowest level cell, not the group cell. in 99% of the time, this

// will be enough. if we consider groups, then it gets too complicated for what it's worth,

// as the groups can span columns and this class only considers one column at a time.

// position fixed, so it isn't restricted to the boundaries of the parent

// only append the dummyContainer to the DOM after it contains all the necessary items

// this element has to be a form, otherwise form elements within a cell

// will be validated while being cloned. This can cause issues such as 

// radio buttons being reset and losing their values.

// we are finished with the dummy container, so get rid of it

// make a deep clone of the cell

// the original has a fixed width, we remove this to allow the natural width based on content

// the original has position = absolute, we need to remove this so it's positioned normally

// we skip ag-row-position-absolute, as this has structural CSS applied that stops the

// element from fitting into it's parent, and we need the element to stretch the parent

// as we are measuring the parents width

// the twig on the branch, the branch on the tree, the tree in the hole,

// the hole in the bog, the bog in the clone, the clone in the parent,

// the parent in the dummy, and the dummy down in the vall-e-ooo, OOOOOOOOO! Oh row the rattling bog....

// Tree Data will have `childrenAfterSort` without any nodes, but

// the current node will still be marked as expansible.

// if the rowModel is `serverSide` as only `clientSide` and `serverSide` create this feature.

// only happens when pivoting, and we are showing root node

// added logic to break out of the loop when the row calculation

// changes while rows are becoming sticky (happens with auto height)

// if first row is an open group, and practically shown, it needs

// to be stuck

// Only spread if we need to.

// in a clean design, each cell would register for each of these events. however when scrolling, all the cells

// registering and de-registering for events is a performance bottleneck. so we register here once and inform

// all active cells.

// only for printLayout - because we are rendering all the cells in the same row, regardless of pinned state,

// then changing the width of the containers will impact left position. eg the center cols all have their

// left position adjusted by the width of the left pinned column, so if the pinned left column width changes,

// all the center cols need to be shifted to accommodate this. when in normal layout, the pinned cols are

// in different containers so doesn't impact.

// add listeners to the grid columns

// if the grid columns change, then refresh the listeners again

// executes all functions in destroyFuncsForColumnListeners and then clears the list

// this function adds listeners onto all the grid columns, which are the column that we could have cellComps for.

// when the grid columns change, we add listeners again. in an ideal design, each CellComp would just register to

// the column it belongs to on creation, however this was a bottleneck with the number of cells, so do it here

// once instead.

// for row models that have datasources, when we update the datasource, we need to force the rowRenderer

// to redraw all rows. otherwise the old rows from the old datasource will stay displayed.

// because this is a model updated event (not pinned rows), we

// can skip updating the pinned rows. this is needed so that if user

// is doing transaction updates, the pinned rows are not getting constantly

// trashed - or editing cells in pinned rows are not refreshed and put into read mode

// if no row nodes provided, then refresh everything

// if the dom is not actually focused on a cell, then we don't try to refocus. the problem this

// solves is with editing - if the user is editing, eg focus is on a text field, and not on the

// cell itself, then the cell can be registered as having focus, however it's the text field that

// has the focus and not the cell div. therefore, when the refresh is finished, the grid will focus

// the cell, and not the textfield. that means if the user is in a text field, and the grid refreshes,

// the focus is lost from the text field. we do not want this.

// gets called from:

// +) initialisation (in registerGridComp) params = null

// +) onDomLayoutChanged, params = null

// +) onPageLoaded, recycleRows, animate, newData, newPage from event, onlyBody=true

// +) onPinnedRowDataChanged, recycleRows = true

// +) redrawRows (from Grid API), recycleRows = true/false

// if a cell was focused before, ensure focus now.

// when doing print layout, we don't explicitly set height on the containers

// we need at least 1 pixel for the horizontal scroll to work. so if there are now rows,

// we still want the scroll to be present, otherwise there would be no way to scroll the header

// which might be needed us user wants to access columns

// on the RHS - and if that was where the filter was that cause no rows to be presented, there

// is no way to remove the filter.

// sets the focus to the provided cell, if the cell is provided. this way, the user can call refresh without

// worry about the focus been lost. this is important when the user is using keyboard navigation to do edits

// and the cellEditor is calling 'refresh' to get other cells to update (as other cells might depend on the

// edited cell).

// we don't wish to dispatch an event as the rowRenderer is not capable of changing the selected cell,

// so we mock a change event for the full width rows and cells to ensure they update to the newly selected

// state

// refresh the full width rows too

// skip this row if it is missing from the provided list

/**
     * @param rowNodes if provided, returns the RowCtrls for the provided rowNodes. otherwise returns all RowCtrls.

// returns CellCtrl's that match the provided rowNodes and columns. eg if one row node

// and two columns provided, that identifies 4 cells, so 4 CellCtrl's returned.

// if no fromIndex then set to -1, which will refresh everything

// let realFromIndex = -1;

// gets called when rows don't change, but viewport does, so after:

// 1) height of grid body changes, ie number of displayed rows has changed

// 2) grid scrolled to new position

// 3) ensure index visible (which is a scroll)

// only try to refocus cells shifting in and out of sticky container

// if the browser supports focus ({ preventScroll })

// AfterScroll results in flushSync in React but we need to disable flushSync for sticky row group changes to avoid flashing

// for speedy lookup, dump into map

// if we are redrawing due to scrolling change, then old rows are in this.rowCompsByIndex

// if we are redrawing due to model update, then old rows are in rowsToRecycle

// all in all indexes in the viewport

// the row can already exist and be in the following:

// rowsToRecycle -> if model change, then the index may be different, however row may

//                         exist here from previous time (mapped by id).

// this.rowCompsByIndex -> if just a scroll, then this will contain what is currently in the viewport

// never animate when doing print layout - as we want to get things ready to print as quickly as possible,

// otherwise we risk the printer printing a row that's half faded (half way through fading in)

// Don't animate rows that have been added or removed as part of scrolling

// when embedding, what gets showed in each section depends on what is pinned. eg if embedding group expand / collapse,

// then it should go into the pinned left area if pinning left, or the center area if not pinning.

// if either of the pinned panels has shown / hidden, then need to redraw the fullWidth bits when

// embedded, as what appears in each section depends on whether we are pinned or not

// include just full width

// if Row Nodes provided, we exclude where Row Node is missing

// if no row comp, see if we can get it from the previous rowComps

// create a new one

// this should never happen - if somehow we are trying to create

// a row for a rowNode that does not exist.

// set node as 'alreadyRendered' to ensure we only recycle rowComps that have been rendered, this ensures

// we don't reuse rowComps that have been removed and then re-added in the same batch transaction.

// if row was used, then it's null

//    the edit is reset - so we want to keep it rendered.

// b) if focused, we want ot keep keyboard focus, so if user ctrl+c, it goes to clipboard,

//    otherwise the user can range select and drag (with focus cell going out of the viewport)

//    and then ctrl+c, nothing will happen if cell is removed from dom.

// c) if detail record of master detail, as users complained that the context of detail rows

// initialiseInvisibleScrollbar should only be called once, but the reason

// we pad the right based on a) if cols are pinned to the right and

// b) if v scroll is showing on the right (normal position of scroll)

// because the user can call rowNode.setExpanded() many times in one VM turn,

// we throttle the calls to ClientSideRowModel using animationFrameService. this means for 100

// row nodes getting expanded, we only update the CSRM once, and then we fire all events after

// CSRM has updated.

// if we did not do this, then the user could call setExpanded on 100+ rows, causing the grid

// to re-render 100+ times, which would be a performance lag.

// we use animationFrameService

// if autoHeight, we want the height to grow to the new height starting at 1, as otherwise a flicker would happen,

// if user is providing document, we use the users one,

// deltaSort - this changes the type of algorithm used only, it doesn't change the sort order. so no point

//           - in doing the sort again as the same result will be got. the new Prop will be used next time we sort.

// ** LIST OF NON REACTIVE, SOME ARGUMENT

// ** For these, they could be reactive, but not convinced the business argument is strong enough,

// the purge there will still be zero rows, meaning the SSRM won't request any rows.

// to kick things off, at least one row needs to be asked for.

// if only one node passed, we start the selection at the top

// this property says how many empty blocks should be in a cache, eg if scrolls down fast and creates 10

// blocks all for loading, the grid will only load the last 2 - it will assume the blocks the user quickly

// scrolled over are not needed to be loaded.

// we don't implement as lazy row heights is not supported in this row model

// if cache params, we require reset only if sort model has changed. we don't need to check

// for filter model, as the filter manager will fire an event when columns change that result

// in the filter changing.

// only reset if we have a valid datasource to working with

// important to return here, as the user could be setting filter or sort before

// data-source is set

// if user is providing id's, then this means we can keep the selection between datasource hits,

// as the rows will keep their unique id's even if, for example, server side sorting or filtering

// is done.

// not sure if these should all be false - noticed if after implementing,

// maybe they should be true?

// if not first time creating a cache, need to destroy the old one

// the user provided datasource

// sort and filter model

// properties - this way we take a snapshot of them, so if user changes any, they will be

// used next time we create a new cache, which is generally after a filter or sort change,

// or a new datasource is set

// if user doesn't provide overflow, we use default overflow of 1, so user can scroll past

// the current page and request first row of next page

// page size needs to be 1 or greater. having it at 1 would be silly, as you would be hitting the

// server for one page at a time. so the default if not specified is 100.

// the cache could create this, however it is also used by the pages, so handy to create it

// here as the settings are also passed to the pages

// for iRowModel

// we render the group summary text e.g. "-> Parent -> Child"...

// only on group rows

// if this is a top level footer, always render`Total` in the left-most cell

// @ts-ignore

// replace whatever newlines are supplied with the style we're using

// first pass, put in the header names of the cols

// if we are in pivotMode, then the grid will show the root node only

// if it's not a leaf group

// when in pivot mode, we always render cols on screen, never 'all columns'

// must be enterprise, so we can just loop through all the nodes

// onlySelectedAllPages: user doing pagination and wants selected items from

// other pages, so cannot use the standard row model as it won't have rows from

// other pages.

// onlySelectedNonStandardModel: if user wants selected in non standard row model

// (eg viewport) then again RowModel cannot be used, so need to use selected instead.

// serialize each node

// here is everything else - including standard row model and selected. we don't use

// the selection model even when just using selected, so that the result is the order

// of the rows appearing on the screen.

// If outerFn provided and outerFn.prototype is a Generator, then outerFn.prototype instanceof Generator.

// The ._invoke method unifies the implementations of the .next,

// .throw, and .return methods.

// Be forgiving, per 25.3.3.3.3 of the spec:

// https://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-generatorresume

// Call delegate.iterator[context.method](context.arg) and handle the

// result, either by returning a { value, done } result from the

// delegate iterator, or by modifying context.method and context.arg,

// setting context.delegate to null, and returning the ContinueSentinel.

// A .throw or .return when the delegate iterator has no .throw

// method always terminates the yield* loop.

// Note: ["return"] must be used for ES3 parsing compatibility.

// If the delegate iterator has a return method, give it a

// chance to clean up.

// If maybeInvokeDelegate(context) changed context.method from

// "return" to "throw", let that override the TypeError below.

// Re-yield the result returned by the delegate method.

// The delegate iterator is finished, so forget it and continue with

// the outer generator.

// Assign the result of the finished delegate to the temporary

// variable specified by delegate.resultName (see delegateYield).

// Resume execution at the desired location (see delegateYield).

// If context.method was "throw" but the delegate handled the

// exception, let the outer generator proceed normally. If

// context.method was "next", forget context.arg since it has been

// "consumed" by the delegate iterator. If context.method was

// "return", allow the original .return call to continue in the

// outer generator.

// Define Generator.prototype.{next,throw,return} in terms of the

// unified ._invoke helper method.

// Setting context._sent for legacy support of Babel's

// function.sent implementation.

// If an exception is thrown from innerFn, we leave state ===

// GenStateExecuting and loop back for another invocation.

// Dispatch the exception by looping back around to the

// context.dispatchException(context.arg) call above.

// Try/catch helper to minimize deoptimizations. Returns a completion

// record like context.tryEntries[i].completion. This interface could

// have been (and was previously) designed to take a closure to be

// invoked without arguments, but in all the cases we care about we

// already have an existing method we want to call, so there's no need

// to create a new function object. We can even get away with assuming

// the method takes exactly one argument, since that happens to be true

// in every case, so we don't have to touch the arguments object. The

// only additional allocation required is the completion record, which

// has a stable shape and so hopefully should be cheap to allocate.

// Dummy constructor functions that we use as the .constructor and

// .constructor.prototype properties for functions that return Generator

// objects. For full spec compliance, you may wish to configure your

// minifier not to mangle the names of these two functions.

// This is a polyfill for %IteratorPrototype% for environments that

// don't natively support it.

// This environment has a native %IteratorPrototype%; use it instead

// of the polyfill.

// Helper for defining the .next, .throw, and .return methods of the

// Iterator interface in terms of a single ._invoke method.

// Define the unified helper method that is used to implement .next,

// .throw, and .return (see defineIteratorMethods).

// When a yielded Promise is resolved, its final value becomes

// the .value of the Promise<{value,done}> result for the

// current iteration.

// If a rejected Promise was yielded, throw the rejection back

// into the async generator function so it can be handled there.

// If enqueue has been called before, then we want to wait until

// all previous Promises have been resolved before calling invoke,

// so that results are always delivered in the correct order. If

// enqueue has not been called before, then it is important to

// call invoke immediately, without waiting on a callback to fire,

// so that the async generator function has the opportunity to do

// any necessary setup in a predictable way. This predictability

// is why the Promise constructor synchronously invokes its

// executor callback, and why async functions synchronously

// execute code before the first await. Since we implement simple

// async functions in terms of async generators, it is especially

// important to get this right, even though it requires care.

// Avoid propagating failures to Promises returned by later

// invocations of the iterator.

// The root entry object (effectively a try statement without a catch

// or a finally block) gives us a place to store values thrown from

// locations where there is no enclosing try statement.

// Return an iterator with no values.

// Regardless of whether this script is executing as a CommonJS module

// or not, return the runtime object so that we can declare the variable

// regeneratorRuntime in the outer scope, which allows this module to be

// injected easily by `bin/regenerator --include-runtime script.js`.

// For the native GeneratorFunction constructor, the best we can

// do is to check its .name property.

// Within the body of any async function, `await x` is transformed to

// `yield regeneratorRuntime.awrap(x)`, so that the runtime can test

// `hasOwn.call(value, "__await")` to determine if the yielded value is

// meant to be awaited.

// Note that simple async functions are implemented on top of

// AsyncIterator objects; they just return a Promise for the value of

// the final result produced by the iterator.

// A Generator should always return itself as the iterator object when the

// @@iterator function is called on it. Some browsers' implementations of the

// iterator prototype chain incorrectly implement this, causing the Generator

// object to not be returned from this call. This ensures that doesn't happen.

// See https://github.com/facebook/regenerator/issues/274 for more details.

// Rather than returning an object with a next method, we keep

// things simple and return the next function itself.

// To avoid creating an additional object, we just hang the .value

// and .done properties off the next function object itself. This

// also ensures that the minifier will not anonymize the function.

// Resetting context._sent for legacy support of Babel's

// Not sure about the optimal order of these conditions:

// If the dispatched exception was caught by a catch block,

// then let that catch block handle the exception normally.

// Exception thrown outside of any try block that could handle

// it, so set the completion value of the entire function to

// throw the exception.

// Ignore the finally entry if control is not jumping to a

// location outside the try/catch block.

// The context.catch method must only be called with a location

// argument that corresponds to a known catch block.

// Deliberately forget the last sent value so that we don't

// accidentally pass it on to the delegate.

// This module should not be running in strict mode, so the above

// assignment should always work unless something is misconfigured. Just

// in case runtime.js accidentally runs in strict mode, we can escape

// strict mode using a global Function call. This could conceivably fail

// if a Content Security Policy forbids using Function, but in that case

// the proper solution is to fix the accidental strict mode problem. If

// you've misconfigured your bundler to force strict mode and applied a

// CSP to forbid Function, and you're not willing to fix either of those

// problems, please detail your unique predicament in a GitHub issue.

// to poll (we limit to 10) looking for the Detail HTMLElement (which will be the only

// child) after the fullWidthCompDetails is set.

// I think this looping could be avoided if we use a ref Callback instead of useRef,

// because React is asynchronous, it's possible the RowCtrl is no longer a valid RowCtrl. This can

// happen if user calls two API methods one after the other, with the second API invalidating the rows

// the first call created. Thus the rows for the first call could still get created even though no longer needed.

// the rowTop is managed by state, instead of direct style manipulation by rowCtrl (like all the other styles)

// as we need to have an initial value when it's placed into he DOM for the first time, for animation to work.

// i found using React for managing classes at the row level was to slow, as modifying classes caused a lot of

// React code to execute, so avoiding React for managing CSS Classes made the grid go much faster.

// increasing the render key forces the refresh. this is undocumented (for React users,

// we don't document the refresh method, instead we tell them to act on new params).

// however the GroupCellRenderer has this logic in it and would need a small refactor

// to get it working without using refresh() returning false. so this hack staying in,

// in React if refresh() is implemented and returns false (or undefined), we force a refresh

// start editing

// stop editing

// if we're using the proxy, we have to manually clear the ref

// Restore focus to the cell if it was focused before and not editing.

/* 391 */

// create or refresh JS cell renderer

// if not showing comp, destroy any existing one and return

// attempt refresh if refresh method exists
